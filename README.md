# Machine Learning playground

## Description

Machine learning playground is an interactive visualization of K-Means Clustering and DBSCAN algorithms, written in
TypeScript using d3.js. 

This playgound is inspired by [Tensorflow - Neural Network Playgound](https://playground.tensorflow.org/).

## Deployment


## Development

To run the visualization locally, run:

- `npm i` to install dependencies
- `npm run build` to compile the app and place it in the `dist/` directory
- `npm start` to run the application

For a fast edit-refresh cycle when developing run `npm start`.
This will start an http server and automatically re-compile the TypeScript,
HTML and CSS files whenever they change.
